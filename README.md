# Chess

This is a C++ project I made on my own time in university.
It is a chess program that you can interact with in the terminal to play a game of chess.

Interact with the board by using arrow keys and enter to select and move chess pieces.

The program should prevent you from making any illegal moves.
Also included the little known "an pasan" rule that allows pawns to capture pawns that passed them with the double initial move.

# How to Use

The Source.exe file within the Chess folder should be able to run the program fine.


#Known Issues
Currently only able move the white(lowwer case) pieces, will resolve this issue at a latter date
